= ExecutionProfilesLoader

This project was developed using Katalon Studio v7.6.6. It should work on every version above v7.0.

== Background

https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/execution-profile-v54.html[GlobalVariables and Execution Profile] is a feature in Katalon Studio that enable users parameterise values of variables out of test script source. With GlobalVariables we can reduce code duplication and reuse test scripts for multiple cases.

The following screenshot shows how we apply Execution Profiles to Test Suites.

As this screenshot indicates, *a user has to choose a single Execution Profile for a test run before you start it*. Your script can not determine programmatically which Profiles to load. You can not apply 2 or more Profiles to a single test run. 

== Problems to solve

I think that Katalon Studio is designed with an implicit assumption that a user would need just a few Execution Profiles with small number of GlobalVariables --- 10 GlobalVariables in 5 Execution Profiles, for example. This assumption may apply to some small projects but not to the real business projects. I find the following problems about GlobalVariable:

1. Let me assume, my project has a GlobalVariable, e.g, `ENVIRONMENT`, declared in multiple Execution Profiles. But I can not remember which Profiles contains that GV. I have to look into the 50 Execution Profiles one by one for the GV `ENVIRONMENT`. It is time-consuming and tiring. *Katalon Studio does not provide any feature that helps me looking up a GlobalVariable amongst bunches of Execution Profiles.*

2. I want to apply *2 or more Profiles to a single test run*. In other words, I want to be able to modularize Execution Profiles into parts; and build a full set of GlobalVariables for a test run by joining selected modulus Profiles.

3. I want a capability that *my test script can choose which Profiles to load programmatically runtime*.

My `ExecutionProfilesLoader` project addresses all these problems and provides sufficient solutions for me. Please have a look into the document for more detail.
